// Shrinks one photo. This file runs as a "Web Worker": a background thread, so
// the heavy work (decoding a 25 MB file, resizing 24 million pixels) does not
// freeze the page. The page sends a file in, and this sends three small files back.
//
// Output for each photo:
//   small    800 px on the long edge   (grids on phones)
//   thumb   1200 px on the long edge   (grids on computers, home page cards)
//   display 3000 px on the long edge   (the full-screen viewer, on every screen)
//   download 3000 px JPEG, NO watermark, only if you ticked "clean copy"; kept
//            private and given out only with a license code
// Every public size gets the watermark, in the style you picked:
//   full   repeated diagonally across the whole photo (strong on the viewer
//          size, lighter on the grid sizes)
//   small  one line in the bottom-right corner
//
// ---------- Storage limit ----------
// Each size has a maximum file size (maxBytes). The photo is first saved at the
// normal quality; if the file is too big (very detailed photos, or Safari, which
// can only save JPEG), it is saved again at the next lower quality, and so on.
// If even the lowest quality is too big, the display size is made a little
// smaller (2400 px). Most photos fit at the first try.
//
// With these limits one photo uses at most about 2.5 MB online, so a set of 60
// photos stays under about 150 MB. (A private clean copy, if you keep one, adds
// about 2 to 4 MB per photo on top.)
//
// There is no separate phone-sized viewer file any more: phones load the same
// 3000 px file as computers. That is slower on phones, but saves storage.
// To change the limits, edit the values below. Only photos uploaded afterwards change.
//
// Drawing onto a canvas and saving it creates a brand new file, so ALL of the
// original's hidden data (EXIF: GPS location, camera serial number) is left behind.
// Before that, we read just the camera details we want to show (exif.js).
